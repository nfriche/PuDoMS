## Downloading Data
In order to get the data, the combined use of the following three repositories are required: 
- https://github.com/jblsmith/matching-salami/tree/master
- https://github.com/DDMAL/SALAMI/tree/main
- https://github.com/DDMAL/SALAMI/tree/main

First, you can download the publicly available mp3 files found in the Internet Archive. This is done using the [SALAMI_download.py](https://github.com/DDMAL/SALAMI/blob/main/SALAMI_download.py) and [id_index_internetarchive.csv](https://github.com/DDMAL/salami-data-public/blob/master/metadata/id_index_internetarchive.csv) files. An updated version of the SALAMI_download.py file (compatible with Python3) can be found in the [data](data.com) folder of this branch.
